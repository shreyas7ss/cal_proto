# Google Calendar Authentication Fix

## Problem
You were getting this error:
```
HttpError 403 when requesting https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/calendars/primary/events
"Request had insufficient authentication scopes."
```

## Root Cause
The original authentication function wasn't requesting the specific scopes needed for Calendar and Tasks access.

## Solution
The issue was in your authentication function. Here's what was wrong and how to fix it:

### Original (Broken) Code:
```python
def authenticate_google_api_colab():
    auth.authenticate_user()  # ‚ùå No scopes specified
    creds, project_id = default()  # ‚ùå No scopes specified
    return creds
```

### Fixed Code:
```python
def authenticate_google_api_colab_fixed():
    auth.authenticate_user(scopes=SCOPES)  # ‚úÖ Scopes specified
    creds, project_id = default(scopes=SCOPES)  # ‚úÖ Scopes specified
    return creds
```

## How to Use the Fix

### Option 1: Use the Standalone File
1. The fixed code is now in `fixed_google_auth.py`
2. In your Colab notebook, run:
   ```python
   exec(open('fixed_google_auth.py').read())
   test_authentication()
   ```

### Option 2: Copy the Fixed Function
Copy this code into a new cell in your notebook:

```python
# Required scopes
SCOPES = [
    'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly',
    'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/tasks.readonly'
]

def authenticate_google_api_colab_fixed():
    """Authenticates with proper scopes to fix 403 error."""
    print("Authenticating to Google Colab to access your Google services...")
    auth.authenticate_user(scopes=SCOPES)  # üîë This is the key fix
    creds, project_id = default(scopes=SCOPES)  # üîë And this
    print("Authentication successful!")
    return creds
```

### Option 3: Update Your Existing Code
In your original notebook, find this line:
```python
google_creds = authenticate_google_api_colab()
```

Change it to:
```python
google_creds = authenticate_google_api_colab_fixed()
```

## What Will Happen Next
1. When you run the fixed code, you'll see a new authentication popup
2. Grant permissions for:
   - Google Calendar (read-only)
   - Google Tasks (read-only)
3. The 403 error should disappear
4. You'll see your actual calendar events instead of mock data

## Key Changes Summary
- ‚úÖ Added `scopes=SCOPES` to `auth.authenticate_user()`
- ‚úÖ Added `scopes=SCOPES` to `default()`
- ‚úÖ This ensures proper permissions are requested and granted
